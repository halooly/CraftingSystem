Alchemy is the science of crafting potions that could be consumed, rubbed, or thrown. They are categorized by  [[Duration]] and [[Type]].

1. To create a potion the recipe must be known by the crafter. If not then he can [[Experiment]] to attempt to discover it. 
2. The Alchemist must then add the necessary [[Reactants]]  to the specified [[Base]], then add a [[Catalyst]] if needed.
3. All ingredients are mixed together in a [[Cauldron]] that outputs the product; no [[Crafting Roll]] needed.
