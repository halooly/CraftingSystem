If you don't know a recipe to a potion you want to make you have **Experiment** to find it.

To Experiment you need to attempt to create the potion blindly by experimenting with different [[Reactants]] and performing a [[Crafting Roll]].

<ins>On Succusses:</ins>
- The [[Base]] is tainted, but the [[Reactants]], and [[Catalyst]] are preserved. 
- You discover 1 of the [[Reactants]] needed for desired potion.

<ins>On Nat Crit:</ins>
- The [[Base]] is tainted, but the [[Reactants]], and [[Catalyst]] are preserved. 
- You discover 2 of the [[Reactants]] needed for desired potion.

<ins>On Failure:</ins>
- The [[Base]] and [[Reactants]] are tainted, but the [[Catalyst]] is preserved.
- An [[Accident]] occurs. 

Regardless of roll if any reactants used in the experiment are present in the experiment then they are considered discover
